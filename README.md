**XML Test Suite Design**  
Test suites tailored to different levels of testing:
1. **Smoke Suite**: A lightweight suite covering critical functionalities to ensure basic application health.
2. **Regression Suite**: A comprehensive suite designed to verify existing features remain unaffected by new updates or fixes.

**Data-Driven Testing**  
To ensure flexibility and coverage, the framework supports data-driven testing using:
- **JSON**: For quick and easily maintainable test data files.
- **MySQL**: For managing complex, relational test data dynamically.
